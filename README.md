Awesome Controller
==================

This is the official repository for the Awesome Controller firmware.


Running Tests
=============
The following instructions work for running the high-level
tests on a Macbook Pro:

* Dependencies
  * Requires Ruby 1.9+
  * brew install cmake (linking failed for me, so I had to `brew link cmake` afterwards)
  * gem install ffi

* Future Enhancements
  * Test build scripts with Linux / Windows
